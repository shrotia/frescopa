Direct trade provides transparency, sustainability, and better income for farmers while giving us control over quality and traceability."

Our head roaster Marcus Chen has 15+ years experience and chemistry background ensuring consistent excellence."

Differences include: higher growing altitudes producing denser, more flavorful beans, careful harvesting of only ripe cherries, precise processing methods preserving flavor, minimal defects in green beans, expert roasting highlighting origin characteristics, and traceability to specific farms or regions. Regular commodity coffee often mixes origins, qualities, and defects, resulting in generic flavor profiles."

                        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                        <p>Fréscopa was born from a passion for exceptional coffee and the belief that every cup should be an experience. Founded in 2018 by coffee enthusiasts Sarah and Marcus, our journey began with a simple mission: to connect coffee lovers with the world's finest beans while supporting the farmers who grow them.</p>
                        
                        <p>From the highlands of Ethiopia to the mountains of Colombia, we travel the world to source our beans directly from farmers who share our commitment to quality and sustainability. Every relationship we build is based on trust, fairness, and a shared love for the craft of coffee growing.</p>
                        
                        <p>What started as a small roastery in San Francisco has grown into a community of coffee lovers who appreciate the artistry, science, and passion that goes into every cup. We believe that great coffee has the power to bring people together, create moments of joy, and make every day a little brighter.</p>
