For example, use 25g of coffee with 375-425ml of water. Adjust based on personal taste: use more coffee (1:14) for stronger brew, or less (1:18) for milder coffee.

Solutions: lower water temperature to 195-205°F, reduce brew time, use a coarser grind, or decrease coffee amount. Also ensure your beans are fresh - stale coffee tastes bitter."

Strain twice through fine mesh or coffee filter for smooth, sediment-free concentrate. Dilute with water, milk, or ice to taste. Cold brew has lower acidity and naturally sweet flavor, staying fresh refrigerated for up to 2 weeks."

The grind should be fine enough that extraction takes 25-30 seconds for a double shot (18-20g yielding 36-40g). If extraction is too fast (under 20 seconds), grind finer. If too slow (over 35 seconds), grind coarser. Consistent grind is crucial - invest in a quality burr grinder for best results."

For espresso machines, run cleaning solution through group head weekly and descale monthly. French presses and pour-over drippers: disassemble and wash all parts. Grinders: brush out grounds weekly, deep clean monthly. Never use soap on anything that touches coffee - it leaves residue affecting flavor."

Pour about twice the weight of coffee in hot water (e.g., 40g water for 20g coffee), wait 30-45 seconds as grounds expand and bubble. This degassing step ensures even extraction by allowing water to properly saturate the grounds. Fresh coffee blooms more dramatically - a sign of quality and freshness. Essential for pour-over, optional for immersion methods."

            "text": "No, you should not reuse coffee grounds for brewing. Coffee extraction removes most solubles (flavor compounds, oils, caffeine) on the first brew. Reused grounds produce weak, bitter, unpleasant coffee with minimal caffeine. However, used grounds have many other uses: compost for gardens, natural deodorizer, exfoliating body scrub, or pest deterrent for slugs and ants."

Stronger coffee flavor, thicker foam cap, traditionally served in smaller cup. Latte: more steamed milk with thin foam layer (1:3:1 ratio espresso:milk:foam, typically 8-12oz). Milder coffee flavor, silkier texture, better canvas for latte art. Both use microfoam texture, not stiff peaks."

                        <h3 style="color: #2c1810; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">Grind Size Matters</h3>
                        <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The grind size dramatically affects extraction and flavor. Coarse for French press, medium for drip, fine for espresso.</p>
                        <ul style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1.2rem;">
                            <li><strong>Extra Coarse:</strong> Cold brew, cowboy coffee</li>
                            <li><strong>Coarse:</strong> French press, percolator</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium-Coarse:</strong> Chemex, pour-over</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Drip coffee makers</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium-Fine:</strong> V60, Aeropress</li>
                            <li><strong>Fine:</strong> Espresso, Moka pot</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 style="color: #2c1810; margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">Water Temperature</h3>
                        <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Water temperature affects extraction rate and flavor balance. Too hot burns, too cool under-extracts.</p>
                        <ul style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1.2rem;">
                            <li><strong>195-205°F (90-96°C):</strong> Optimal range for most brewing</li>
                            <li><strong>200°F (93°C):</strong> Sweet spot for pour-over</li>
                            <li><strong>185-195°F (85-90°C):</strong> Light roasts, delicate flavors</li>
                            <li><strong>205°F (96°C):</strong> Dark roasts, full extraction</li>

                        <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The golden ratio ensures consistent strength and flavor. Adjust to your taste preferences.</p>
                        <ul style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1.2rem;">
                            <li><strong>1:15-1:17:</strong> Standard pour-over ratio</li>
                            <li><strong>1:12-1:15:</strong> Stronger, more concentrated</li>
                            <li><strong>1:17-1:20:</strong> Lighter, more subtle</li>

                        <p style="color: #666; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Different brewing methods require different contact times between coffee and water.</p>
